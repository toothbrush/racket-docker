Happy fluffy yaks abound in verdant pastures.

This is a small sample application written as a bit of a learning exercise, to figure out how to "Dockerise" a Racket app.  I make grateful use of jackfirth's [Racket Docker base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jackfirth/racket/~/dockerfile/).

The Makefile has two targets, `test` and `build`, which do as they say on the tin.
